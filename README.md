### Vision
Help novice users stay afloat in a [post-Snowden world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)) that is increasingly interconnected, complex, and dangerous by creating rich relationships between novice users and technology experts using the operating system as the basis for two-way communication with each other.

### Mission
Use cutting edge security practices to provide complete lifecycle (from purchase to trash) protection from ongoing, persistent security and privacy threats for novice computer users.

### Motto
Security starts here. Stealing the best ideas from the entire open source community (a.k.a. Proudly Found Elsewhere).
